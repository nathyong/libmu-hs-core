to compile and run MuBF, you will need:

sbt version 0.13.9 or above - the scala build tool, you can get it from most package managers however, ubuntu 14 LTS uses an outdated version and you will have to install sbt from its website (http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
sudo pacman -S sbt, sudo apt-get install sbt ...

ghc-7.10, cabal-1.22 - In general, users tend to install the haskell platform available from most package managers, users should check out (https://www.haskell.org/platform/) to install.

openjdk 6, 7 or (preferably) 8 - available on many package managers, as well as from oracle (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

haskell packages (hspec, parsec & c-storable-deriving). available from cabal:
cabal update
cabal should automatically install missing dependencies (during cabal build) however if not,
you can install hspec, parsec & c-storable-deriving which are usually missing

clone the repository:
git clone -r https://github.com/microvm/bf-mu.git

cd mu-bf

you need to manually change MuBF.cabal on the line specified ghc-options: under executable MuBF, change /home/name_here/Documents/git/bf-mu/microvm-refimpl2/cbinding/ to point to bf-mu/microvm-refimpl2/cbinding/ for your system.

for first time use, a makefile has been provided to compile mu refimpl and MuBF (with tests)
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/home
make

This could take a while, since sbt is very slow to update and compile.

to run tests:
cabal test

to test MuBF with a bf program, copy test-program/hello.bf into dist/build/MuBF/

./MuBF -f hello.bf -c -r

This should print a large amount of debug info, and near the bottom. Hello World!
If however, an error occurs claiming that the linker could not find refimpl2start.so, then you must manually set DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATH.
export DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/bf-mu/refimpl/cbinding/
This is a known issue with mac and setting -rpath for clang 

in future, you can run
./MuBF -f file.bf -r | grep -v DEBUG
to remove debug and type check information

future builds can be done via
cabal configure --enable-tests && cabal build
